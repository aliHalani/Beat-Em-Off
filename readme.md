## How To Play

Use the arrow keys to shoot fireballs at enemies until the level is complete. Every enemy eliminated with a fireball provides one point, and every fireball that times out without hitting an enemy takes away one point.

Each progressive level sees more enemies that spawn faster, and reduces the distance a fireball can travel before timing out.

## How To Run

JavaFX libraries must be downloaded onto the machine, and the path containing the libraries must be placed into an environment variable `JAVA_FX_HOME`.
Once this is done, the project can be built in IntelliJ using the provided build configuration.
